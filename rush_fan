hi!  I am trying to consolidate my online id's as "workingman" but I see you have the github ID already :)   

I'm hoping you are willing to part with it (doesn't seem active).  I'll make it worth your hassle:  $50?

Let me know: geoffrey.routledge@gmail.com (I was too late at gmail... but I got the twitter handle :)

Thanks!
Geoff
